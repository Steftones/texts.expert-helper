<h1>Google Drive Instructions</h1>
<p>To use this tool you will need to get free access to the Google Drive API.</p>
<p>Once you have access, you will have a 'Client ID', 'Client Secret' and 'Refresh token'. You can then navigate to wherever you copied this project on your computer, open up `config.js` in a text editor, input the information and save the file.
</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to get all the information you need - it should take about 10 minutes. If the process changes for whatever reason, google the subheadings.</p>
